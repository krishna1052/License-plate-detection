## Detailed Design
### Data source and validation
The data utilized for training and validation of the license plate recognition system consisted of a diverse set of images containing Indian license plates captured under varying environmental conditions and scenarios. The dataset encompassed a wide range of license plate designs, fonts, sizes, and orientations to ensure the robustness and generalization capability of the developed system.

Data collection involved sourcing images from both publicly available datasets and custom capture sessions to cover a comprehensive spectrum of real-world scenarios. Images were captured using different cameras and devices to simulate varying lighting conditions, angles, distances, and perspectives commonly encountered in practical applications.

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the system, rigorous validation procedures were conducted using annotated ground truth data. Each image in the dataset was meticulously annotated to delineate the exact location and content of license plates, including individual characters. The annotations served as reference points for evaluating the system's performance across different metrics. To comprehensively evaluate the system's performance, multiple key metrics are employed:

- Character Segmentation Accuracy: Gauging the system's accuracy in segmenting individual characters from license plates.
- Character Recognition Accuracy: Assessing the CNN model's accuracy in recognizing and interpreting segmented characters.
- Overall System Accuracy: Calculating the overall accuracy of the entire license plate recognition system in retrieving and presenting the correct license plate number.
